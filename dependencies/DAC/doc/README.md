# CS_DAC_10bit_ihp

This repository contains the design of a **10-bit Current-Steering Digital-to-Analog Converter (CS DAC)**  
implemented using the **IHP SG13G2 (130 nm BiCMOS) open-source PDK**.

The project includes schematic-level design, SPICE simulations, and basic layout generation using open-source EDA tools such as **xschem**, **ngspice**, and **KLayout**.

---

## 🛠 Tools Required

- **xschem** – schematic capture  
- **ngspice** – circuit simulation  
- **KLayout** – layout and GDS handling  
- **IHP SG13G2 PDK** (`open_pdks.ihp-sg13g2`)  

Recommended: UNIC-CASS / IHP preconfigured environment.

# Running Simulations
Open schematics
cd xschem
xschem CS_DAC_10b.sch
or open a specific block:
xschem 4MSB_weighted.sch
Run testbench (SPICE)
Example:
ngspice CS_DAC_10b_test.spice
Waveforms are stored in .raw files and can be viewed with ngspice or Gaw.
